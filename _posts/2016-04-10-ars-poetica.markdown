My words are twisting their hair with twisted fingers, hiding  
under the floral skirts of dysfunctional mothers: the delicate  
words of the delicatessen worker who doesn’t know English  
but knows how to say bagel, of the elderly minister who thinks  
he can speak, then realizes he cannot. I’m imagining  
my audience fully clothed, wearing wool sweatervests  
over striped collared shirts, black slacks and their toes  
tapping to the beat of my shallow breath. A subway station  
filled with the sound of one thousand and one  
tiny taps. Can you see the minister’s eye watering  
the flowers with vinegar? His hand spelling it?  
The subway train is running late, the sign flashing the words:  
“Delay in Both Directions.” Two thousand and two  
tiny taps. Above ground, where the wind’s cold  
against naked ankles, I feel the asphalt tremble,  
stream steam through the slatted vents, making home  
for the homeless. Two grey blankets, striped with exhaust,  
graphite dust. I’m letting my words take off  
their wet boots, wool socks, warm their cold feet  
and make home on single sheets of slow-turning paper.  
I’m boiling water, spelling steam until my letters open  
like sweaty fists unclenching. The correspondence  
between a hand and its thumb, between a turquoise ring  
and its twisted mother, between a tapping toe  
and rising dough.
