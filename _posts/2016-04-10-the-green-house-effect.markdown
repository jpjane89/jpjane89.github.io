A woman holds a cat meowing to be  
let into the cool, green house. Her head  
is rain-slicked: a greased globe resting  

on a bowed axis. The timer is going off—  
I’m opening the microwave and I’m  
burned. The radio reports that  

yesterday the ocean lost feeling  
of its sand-lips and began drooling  
blood, fish intestines. Tin pails  

collecting soaked hums at a market  
where I buy Portuguese oranges,  
wrapped tight in bright red tissue.  

The umbrella salesman’s catcalls  
and the cat’s. I’m floating on pond ice  
carrying twenty-pound weights  

as the woman lets go, contemplating  
gravity with fur, the conversion  
of pounds, syllables in meow,  

cotton shirts, the economy.  
In a nearby greenhouse, we split  
seeds, divide our words  

into letters and leaves.  
Tomorrow’s forecast is the same:  
we are expecting blue flames.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
