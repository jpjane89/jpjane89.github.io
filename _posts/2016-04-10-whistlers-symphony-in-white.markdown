Behind the lace curtains, voices whisper  
falling leaves. Light drips from bare  

canvasses hung with thread, needles sewn   
into walls. She stands, holding thirsty   

chalk palms. She is soft. Nails  
turned to pale flesh, dripping fresh  

blood and flower buds. The sting of open  
wounds and nectar streams through  

her periwinkle veins. Her lips draped  
like silk, like oil paint. Neck melts  

into dress, a candle dripping warmed wax,  
cooling into a tightly-tied bow. She has scattered  

petals across the velvet rug so she can pick them  
up one by one, arrange them according to which weighs  

heaviest. If her eyes were closed, she would be  
a phantom, a woman. She is a girl,  

a glass vase coated with the ashes of one  
dried white rose, a gloved hand holding still  

and still shaking. The only member of a symphony  
made of the air particles between two breaths.  

Listen, the voices murmur, listen.  

The conductor waves his thin baton,  
violins warp to the shape of her stare.
