A half-empty glass of water sinking  
a dried lemon slice, a fingernail  
curled inwards like a shell dragged  

ashore by the beaten sea. The rickety  
globe that’s been spun too many times—  
the wind shifts and its axis slips, like rain-beads  

snaking down a waterproof jacket  
soaked limp. Having neglected gravity,  
a doctor’s scale is compensating  

with brochures about sinus infections.  
Shoelaces binding the tongue  
of black-and-white striped sneakers,  

a mood-ring warning the palm-sweat  
it might be jealous of an earache. The last  
key cast by the world’s most famous locksmith  

only unlocks the birdcage of the widow  
who lives alone with her husband’s  
ghost. The picture frame that came  

with a photo of a faceless family  
and the double-stick tape that held  
that photo in place, un-stuck—  

an opaque mirror, the skin-  
thin film of scalded milk  
and the outline of a bruised pear.
