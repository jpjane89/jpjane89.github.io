When the clouds turn dark, I will braid  
the rain into your hair. I will fit  
your tears into the wrinkles  
of my knuckles and the space between  

my fingernail and flesh. I will whisper  
you the whistle of warming water.  
When the oak begins to rot, you  
will be inside, cutting pieces of brown  

paper into the size of seeds. I will catch  
your scraps on my tongue, swallow  
the shape of your fingertips. I want  
to grow a tree inside of me and name it  

you. Lay your head on me,  
listen to my veins sing to you  
about blood and salt, sweet  
cherry-colored throat drops.  

The fox that followed you  
to sleep last night hiding underneath  
the picnic table in the yard, napping.  
His paws cling to your storybook,  

the one about barn animals  
and the storm, a leaky roof  
and the old man who couldn’t stand  
the noise. When the wind worms through  

the crack between window and sill,  
the sound of a hiss will weave itself  
through your pillow. You will sink into my chest,  
a wishing well that echoes your breath.
