Shirtsleeves buttoned,  
ballooned: a billowing body  
advertising The One Time Only,  
Limited Edition necktie  
made of leaves stitched  
together with the silk-hair  
of cornstalks. The shrubbery snobs  
turn their pruned hedges, look  
away, the shame of knowing  
the bitter taste of mulch. Below,  

grass fingers catch  
the sun-smell dripping  
from shift-cuffs. Wrinkles  
etched into flesh  
worn from picking dirt  
for worms—a modest living  
fades with the smooth licks  
of lemon-scented  
pollen drops. The weeds  

have staged a protest by the wooden  
fence, demanding access  
to the other side of the lawn  
where Shirt-Tail & Company  
doesn’t leak chemicals into the  
groundwater. Dandelion heads  
spin to the sound of sirens—  

cops circling the street looking  
for the man who’s run away  
with a pair of slacks.  
The same old story: how the wind  
got loose and never was caught.
