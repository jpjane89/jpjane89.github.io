A cup of browned water and a windowpane.  
Earth-colored scrapes of canvas peeking  
through the flowerbed’s painted squares:  
a thin brush and cold two weeks. I dip my  

fingertips in yellow pigment, spill my handprint  
upon the unsoiled soil, clothe its hollow body  
in threads as thin as bulb roots—  

palm etchings. Like when the tree  
outside my window shed its finger-leaves  
and arm-branches: a barked bone,  

warped and fractured. I drew in spiraled  
twig-limbs and when the rain came, soaked  
my skin in puddles of watered black ink,  
let the fields dry gray. The illusion of being  

whole—how I can paint a path  
for a figure who walks for days  
not knowing he has nowhere to go, a figure  

whose face I see in the clouded cup  
but don’t yet know. And with eyes  
closed, I can still see purple  
petal-stained charcoal lids.
