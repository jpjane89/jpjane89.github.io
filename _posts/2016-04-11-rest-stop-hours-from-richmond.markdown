The cat hides under a brown paper bag.  
Sits on yellowing grass, yet to be diagnosed  
with drought, alcoholism, or unemployment.  

I arrive, a coughed-up tumbleweed, an exhale  
in the motorway’s purr. A dusty van door  
that reads Lick me. Inside the gas station/  

deli, crumbs of air pile between aisles of neon  
orange attempts at cheese & crackers. White  
bread is sealed in plastic like moist fingers  

wrapped in flesh-toned band-aids.  
A sticky floor and a gumball machine selling  
vintage coins. I’ve been told there’s a difference  

between a lottery ticket and rabid deer, between  
a bathtub full of crushed ice and capitalism, between  
a piss-colored toilet seat and a toilet seat  

covered in piss. The smell of boiled hot dogs  
and cigarette smoke with an expiration date  
of April 1, 1982: the day the exit sign  

fell from the overpass and landed on the man  
and his pregnant wife. The day before the rain stopped  
and the meteorologist lost his job, too.
