Pink slippers silked  
in grass-lashes, dripping  
with dew the sky  
gave to the earth  

tonight. Asleep on  
dimpled mattresses, a dozen  
princesses, egg-white  
skin brushed with rose-  

tint, eyes sealed with lake-salt.  
Sheets creamed with light  
from a silver sliver—  
an earring without its jewel:  

a thumbprint the size  
of a moon-tear. In the morning,  
they peel damp petals  
from their heels, arrive  

barefoot at the table  
made from the walnut tree  
that refused to root.  
They sit and are served:  

Forty-eight pairs of slippers  
worn out in three weeks? Their father  
asks. Their painted lips  
refuse to crack. Still,  

he stares as they rise and leave.  
Their slick shells slipping  
out of sight. He doesn’t see—  
below their golden  

gowns, their toes  
braid the stairwell  
with ribbons of  
yolk.
