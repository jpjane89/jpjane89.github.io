*After Billy Collins*

Two months ago, I pulled my vinyl blind—  
the roll up kind—and it didn’t roll up. 
No, this morning, it was not in the mood  
to curl inside of itself, shut off  
from the world, obediently wait for me  
to come back, late at night  
violently needing, wanting,  
pulling.  

The only way I knew to respond  
to the blind’s new-found stubbornness  
was with stubbornness of my own—  
I yanked and yanked, convinced  
my human strength could out-match  
that of synthetic fiber.  

I didn’t anticipate the resilience,  
the fortitude of pent-up anger,  
the unrelenting need to prove superiority  
that I was confronted with.  
This was not a battle of equals.  

And so, I was forced to surrender, to slowly  
back away from my fogged window.  
Shocked, baffled.  
The blind bitterly hanging onto  
its wooden rod by one single staple.  
Its body mangled—   

a flat sheet contorted  
into some sort of conical hut,  
a bastion of resistance.  
My room, a dark cave  
with only two small triangles of morning-  
light: testaments to the waged war.  

Two months later, the vinyl blind still clings  
to its staple. I can’t decide  
if I let it remain out of respect  
or laziness. Or have I grown to like  
the pure geometric reminders  
of my human fallibility?  
Feeling my imperfection  
lit on my face each morning.
