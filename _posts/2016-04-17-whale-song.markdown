Ten thousand miniature violins bowed  
in unison and one that we do not play  
because it is strung with baleen bristles  
from the sea’s last humpback whale.  

No, that is a violin we do not play.  
We do not dare, fearful of  
over-exposure to longing.  

We keep it locked in a stained-glass  
chamber, the key to which is kept  
inside an overgrown oyster 
we found the other summer.  

The summer when the tide reversed  
and instead of going out, 
it went in. 

Don’t you remember that summer?  
The radio suddenly went static—  
how we learned the waves had changed. 

But sometimes I have this dream  
where I am the one  
inside the stained-glass chamber and 

I am scratching my thin nails  
along the tone-deaf walls,  
first up and down,  
then side-to-side— 

*can you hear*  
*me in here?*  

*i am calling you,*    
*i am calling for you.*    

*for you. i am for you*  
*calling.*   

*me. you. hear me?*  
*i am here*

I often awaken drenched  
in my sea-salt sweat,  
heart pumping to a maniac melody. 
My nails mere shards, my voice brittle. 

Can’t you remember the song 
that always played that summer? 
Here, listen to my chest. 
It is still echoing inside me.
