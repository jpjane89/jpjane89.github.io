In the morning, I awake  
to the sound of Cyndi Lauper  
streaming out the bathroom door.  
Mom, face-masked, chipping away  

at stale-white radiator paint.  
Relentless like a tide   
of steady waves, washing ashore,  
one after another, erasing  

sole-imprints and drip-castles.  
Her hair wrapped  
up in a magenta and turquoise   
scarf, she is the goddess of  

*do-it-yourself*. Not like DIY.  
Like the grey stain of charcoal  
left on your palm after a night  
of figure drawing. Like   

the difference between white   
and *minced onion* white. Like  
a bouquet of hand-picked wild-  
flowers on the dining-room table.   

As I stand in front of the mirrored  
bathroom cabinet, my face lit by the warmth  
emanating from the art-deco side-lamps,  
I wonder what does it mean to be  

the daughter of this goddess?  
I turn to look at her, squatting next  
to the bathtub, scraping. The answer:  
I grab a knife and start to chip away.
