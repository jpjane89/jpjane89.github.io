I love that I can always feel you here with me  

I love that you keep movin’ in these ways that   
*dammmmnnnn*  
I didn’t even know you could  
even after all these—  
what has it been, almost 27 years?   

That way you bounce bounce right back up   
when I give you what you need   
and hell even when sometimes I don’t  

You gettin’ rolled and you just rollin’ with it   

I scrape you and I work you and you are tired and I don’t care and you ache and I would   rather break you than listen to you  

Then you remind me that I cannot ignore you  

You make me surrender  
Keep me humble  

Because even when you falter,   
the color is such a magnificent red   

I love the messages you whisper me,   
the signals you send me,   
how you teach me to care  

How you love to get *downnnn*   

When that beat starts,   
you make me stop whatever I’m doing and hit it  

*Hot damn*  

When you get into that flow,   
you are in your groove   
and I am just along for the ride  

Places I cannot go on my own  
Sun-filled, joyous spaces that inspire, excite, and enlighten  

I love that you evolve, change, respond with such natural fluidity  

To think that for so long I thought it was *you* who needed me!  

When in reality I am nothing without you.
