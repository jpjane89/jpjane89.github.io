Am I bleeding red nail polish? Number 420: Boston University crimson red. That cannot be real. I cannot be real. A balloon head filled with lead nails. Just waiting to pop. To be popped. What don’t you ever shut up? Like a polar bear trapped in ice – it was such a sad scene. How are you feeling? Like the world is fucked. No, but how are *you* feeling? Medium-rare, partially undercooked. Oh, and I think I hate myself. Exactly in the middle school emo kind of way. Perhaps nothing more. You got me the studded collar I wanted? Like that Goo Goo Dolls song we used to sing—-completely generic and completely touching. Is it blasphemy to listen to a symphony just to score the music? Depends on the use case and mostly yes, often no. Logic is a bossy best friend.
