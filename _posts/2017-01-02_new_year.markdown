Node 1 disconnected from Node 2. Reason unknown, something about transient load /
the start of the New Year. Walgreens has a two-for-one special on toilet paper— do they know something I do not know? Maybe it’s about time to paint my nails #421, begin going by a cute nickname, like *cookie* or *raccoon*. Tell me something new! Does your left big toe feel like a baby carrot? Or, better yet, do you know the best way to optimize my search for contentment? It’s like listening to a symphony just to score the music. Please leave the bedroom door open - the sound of the refrigerator’s heartbeat is what puts me to sleep.
